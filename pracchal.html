            I am not sure how I got this job, I just wrote a bunch of impressive sounding skills on my resume, and they
            hired me! I use my extensive experience Googling things, until I find the answer... But that also
            appears to be what everyone else here is doing.

            I mostly spent my time playing solitaire when my boss wasn't looking, or pretending to be on the phone.
            One time the phone rang while I had it to my ear, and that is how I got fired.

            After the <i>"incident"</i> at kindergarten, Mum says no schools would not accept me, so I was homeschooled
            instead.
            This involved my Mum going out to brunches with her friends, and me learning what I could from Google.
